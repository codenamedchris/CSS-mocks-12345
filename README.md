# CSS-mocks-12345
Springboard project with starter HTML demonstrating CSS positioning. 
Expectation is to focus on using positioning, rather than other CSS concepts like margins, flexbox, or floats.
MY goal is to modify the CSS so that the page looks like each of the given screenshots.
View in 100% zoom.
